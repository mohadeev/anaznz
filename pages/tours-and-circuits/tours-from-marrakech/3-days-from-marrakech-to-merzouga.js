          I have booked a trip with Ur Excursions with my friends. We have been
          3 days in Merzouga and on the Sahara Desert. The attention is
          incredible, all the worker guys are really kind and funny, I have felt
          really comfortable. We have done a excursion with 4x4 by the dunes,
          surf on the dunes, meet the berber culture and share nice moments with
          the guides. At night we joy of a delicious dinner and of a music and
          dance moments at the middle of the desert, on the tents with the fire
          camp. I hope i will repeat this beautiful experience in my life.
          Absolutly amazing! Thank you to all the worker guys. I recommend Ur
          Excursions!

          As a rather cynical traveller, I usually avoid these types of
          activities, which I call tourist traps but these guys were great. Very
          laid back but attentive, they took care of every detail. The food was
          excellent, the whole experience just overwhelms you and the desert
          camp is something I will remember for a long time to come. Value for
          money? Absolutely!!.

          We have visited Morocco for the first time, and we have found it to be
          an absolutely beautiful place (North and South) and rich in amazing
          culture. The people of Morocco have their mix of good and bad as do
          any country. When we visited Fes before our tour, we had a bad
          experience that made us worried about the Desert tour to come. When we
          first met Lhou, we had no expectations other than just surviving our
          trek through the Sahara and trying to have fun. For putting up with us
          for 3 days, he has shown us hospitality that completely blew our
          minds. He was very friendly, helpful, considerate, knowledgeable, good
          at what he does, and overall he has made our Morocco experience that
          much better as our tour guide. We praise Ur Excursions for providing
          with us the best tour experience that we could have ever asked for,
          especially with Lhou. For 2 quiet guys wanting to go on adventure and
          trying to live our Sahara Desert dreams, I strongly recommend this
          tour company and driver.

          Said put this trip together at the very last minute for my 11 year old
          son and myself. The trip was certainly beyond our expectations. Our
          guide, Mohamed, was very kind and knowledgeable about life in Atlas,
          the desert and Nomad people. We spent a night at Riad Dades where the
          chef prepared wonderful Moroccan dishes. Riding camel in the sunset
          was such a memorable moment and the night stay in a camp with other
          travelers with dinner and music entertainment was a highlight of our
          trip. We spent 3 nights in Fez. We had another guide Said who is a
          local resident in Medina and a historian who took us though the
          Medina. We enjoyed historic sites, artisans, food and shopping. On the
          last day, Mohamed took us to Chefchaouen for a day trip. We recommend
          you take a day to visit this blue city! Special thank you to Mohamed
          who drove us for 5 days. You are such a warm and kind person. Thank
          you for stopping every time we requested to care for stray cats and
          dogs! I would love to bring the rest of my family to Morocco again.

          We did not know what to expect in advance. But we certainly did not
          expect this great experience. We were so warmly welcomed by our driver
          Hassan and by the tour leader Ibrahim. They gave us a glimpse into
          life in the desert and they looked after us super well with great food
          and fun activities. Climbing the highest dune in the desert was the
          real highlight for us. We had a super nice view over the desert and
          afterwards we ran down the dune. After two nights in the desert,
          campfires, music after dinner, trips with the camel, lunch at the
          locals and playing soccer with all the tour leaders, it was time to
          return to the bustle of the city and then go back to the Netherlands.
          Ibrahim and the rest, thank you so much for this wonderful experience
          that we will never forget!
